the original game uses the index/style/function filenames.

the revamped game uses the game.html/css/js filenames.

the song is from Bravely Default
the sprites are from Blazblue, Under Night In-Birth, Persona 4 Arena, and Guilty Gear (all fighting games)
i found a gif on youtube from shutterstock as well
some other art elements that i don't know the original source but as also not mine, so credit where credit is due.
